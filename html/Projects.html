        <h2> Photography- Reimagined Spaces </h2> <hr/>

            <p> The prompt of this project was to photograph two spaces, one at Fordham University and one somewhere in NYC, and reimagine it be more interesting or useful. <br/>
                I took 2 pictures, one wide and one close up, and used Adobe Photoshop to reimagine it. <br/>
                My two subjects were Argo Tea and Utopia Park, two places I have frequently visited and thought they could be improved upon. For the imagined Argo Tea photos, I thought it would be a great space to inspire a little                        donation with a coin collector and added a little bit of fun in the space with a floor projector. For the imagined Utopia Park photos, I added a formal running trail to help the runners have a space dedicated for                 them.</p>

        <h2> Videography- Documentary </h2> <hr/>
           
            <p>In this project, I worked with my partner Marlena to conceptualize and film before solo editing a cohesive documentary. <br/> <br/>
               The premise of the film is based on the differences between me and Marlena. <br/>
               I am a commuter student attending at the Lincoln Center campus while Marlena attends at the Rose Hill campus. <br/>
               Despite the differences between location and schedule, we both are able to come together as a part of Fordham University. </p>
